# comfy-pants: custom nodes for ComfyUI
This repo contains a number of QoL nodes I made for myself that I figured I may as well make available for everyone else.
# Nodes
- Make Square Node
  - Will pad an image to make it square with a chosen filling strategy
- Interrogate Node
  - Feed clip-interrogator an image and get its output as a string
- TextEncodeAIO
  - Tried to hack StylePile-like (the A1111 extension, shoutout btw) behavior into a ClipTextEncode node, but I'm not sure I'm even doing it right.
